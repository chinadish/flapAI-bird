FLAPPY BIRD!

A basic recreation of the game, and a genetic reinforcement learning algo to play it.

It's my first NN, and I mostly have no idea what I'm doing (also there are better AI flappy birds available; you probably shouldn't be looking at this one).

Run the file genetic.py to start the AI; run the file flap.py to play the game yourself.
